fg_rm is the set of tools used in ADD REFERENCE to study the efficiency
of three different blind foreground cleaning methods for HI intensity 
mapping. fg_rm is written in C and C++.

1 Installation.
  a) Modify the appropriate fields in the Makefile, in particular the paths
     to the dependencies' headers and libraries
  b) typing 'make' should do the trick

2 Dependencies.
  fg_rm uses several external libraries, which need to be installed before
  compiling it:
    a) GSL - GNU Scientific Library (version >= 1.16)
    b) FFTW - Fastest Fourier Transform of the West (version >= 3.3.3)
    c) HEALPix's C library (version >=3.11)
    d) libsharp - Library for spherical harmonic transforms
    e) CFITSIO
    f) IT++ (version >= 4.2)

3 Usage.
  To run fg_rm just type
    $ ./fg_rm <param filename>
  where <param filename> is the path to a parameter file controling the
  behaviour of fg_rm. The public version of the code comes with a sample
  param file (param.ini). The comments included in it are fairly explanatory.

4 Output.
  Depending on the parameters used to run fg_rm it will generate four
  different types of files:
    a) Foreground-cleaned maps: a set of HEALPix files containing a
       the cleaned temperature maps.
    b) Angular power spectra: a file containing 4 columns in this order:
        1- Multipole number l
        2- Angular power spectrum of the foreground-cleaned map
        3- Angular power spectrum of the foreground-free map
        4- Angular power spectrum of the cleaning residuals
    c) Radial power spectra: a file containing 4 columns in this order:
        1- Radial wave number k_parallel
        2- Radial power spectrum of the foreground-cleaned map
        3- Radial power spectrum of the foreground-free map
        4- Radial power spectrum of the cleaning residuals
    d) Principal eigenvalues (only for PCA).

  For the file types a-c, one file will be written for each input map.
  Both the input and output files should have a suffix _XXX where XXX
  is a 3-digit integer number identifying each frequency band. This
  format is automatically used by the public code CRIME
  (http://intensitymapping.physics.ox.ac.uk/CRIME.html).
